	-->if we have n number of iteration and we are running for n number of iteration.
	
	-->Loop control statementswill take resposibilty for the entire excution procress.

		loop will take care the entire excution procress behaviour
		
		every loop will work from inicialization state to the termination state but there may be a state that a loop cab be terminated abnormally
		when the loop is terminated all the variable in that scop will be lost 
		
		A variable can be used in side of the loop
		
What are three loop controlstatement?
	we have 
			-->break,
				It is used inside the loop.
				it is used to come outside the loop.
				break is always terminate that abnormally terminate the loop.
				generally the the break statement is always planned as a part of loop design to idetify the external condition that make look abnormal 
				it is embedded in a branch control statement like if 
			
			syntax
				while condtion1:
					operation 01
					operation 02
					operation 03
					
					if(abnormal):
						break
						
					operation02
					operation03 
		
		
		--> continue
