"""Double recurrsion

as per the recurrsion theory double recurrsion is the extenstion of the primitive or single recurrsion

in double recurrsion, the same function is called two times in it defination having it own based condition and recursive statement 

when double recurrsion is implemeneted each recurrsion call has it own individual stack forward trackin and reverse traction with each recursive call individualy
